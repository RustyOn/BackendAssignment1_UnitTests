# Experis Academy Backend Assignment1 - Hero Creator

## Description
This project was created as part of an Accelerated Learning course at Noroff. The goal of the project was to practice C# and OOP.

The code contains a bare hero creator that does not implement any "playable" code per se. It instead focuses on coding of classes and unit testing.

Each hero has a specific class that steers that heroes' growth, damage as well as what equipment is available to them.
The unit tests were built according to the assignmnet specifications.
